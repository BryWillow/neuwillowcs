/// <summary>
/// A dendritic spine is a single neurotransmitter binding site on a dendrite. 
/// A dendritic spine can receive multiple types of neurons simultaneously.
/// Dendritic spines are important in neuroplasticity.
/// Specificially, they change shape, size, and in number in a short amount of time.
/// Smaller, less mature, can spontaneously disappear and appear in a matter of hours.
/// Dendritic spines are highly involved in brain injuries, conditions, and diseases.
/// 
/// Note:
/// A single neuron can have many (1-1000+) dendrites.
/// A single dendrite can have many (1000+) dendritic spines.
/// 
/// Example:
/// Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum have many, many dendrites.
/// Bipolar neurons have one dendrite.
